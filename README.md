# optidef

Optidef is a small library that provides a standard set of environments for writing optimization problems. 


## Features

The most important features are:

- Different alignment alternatives between the constraints, objective function and the other problem components.

- Implemenation of a short format where "minimize" is substituted by "min" and "subject to" by "s.t."

- It references optimization problem using three different policies: 
   * No equation is referenced
   * The problem is referenced with a single label
   * Each equation has an individual reference.

- Limitless number of constraints.

- Four types of optimization problems:
   * minimize
   * maximize
   * arg mini
   * arg maxi

## Usage

Import the package by directly adding \usepackage{optidef} to your LaTeX document. Consult the documentation for different examples and syntax usage.


## Syntax
    
The syntax to define an optimization problem is given by:
 
        >\begin{mini#}|sizeFormat|[constraintFormat]
            {optimizationVariable}
            {objectiveFunction \label{objectiveReference}}
            {\label{problemReference}}  
            {problemResult}
            \addConstraint{LHS.1}{RHS.1 \label{Const.1}}{extraInfo.1}
            \addConstraint{LHS.2}{RHS.2 \label{Const.2}}{extraInfo.2}
            .
            .
            \addConstraint{LHS.N}{RHS.N \label{Const.N}}{extraInfo.N}
        \end{mini#}


where mini# takes any of the following values: 

 - mini\* for no referencing
 - mini! for referencing each equation 
 - mini for referencing with a single label the whole problem. 
    
The last two defined problem parameters, "\label{optimizationProblem}"" and "optimizationResult", are mandatory to allow line breaking between the 6 parameters.

After the definition of this parameters, the environment accepts the definition of an infinite number of constraints.

Finally note that \begin{mini#} can be substituted by \begin{maxi#}, \begin{argmini#} or \begin{argmaxi#}.
